Ingredients:
* 500g chicken thighs
* 400g Walnuts
* 1L water
* 1 quince
* 1 tsp salt (add more to taste)
* 1 tsp tumeric
* 1 onion
* 14 tbsp Pomegrante molasses

Steps:
1. Blend walnuts until there a no crumbs left and it becomes a paste
2. Put 1L water in a pan and bring it to a boil and then add the walnut paste. Let simmer for 1 hour.
3. After 1 hour add the pomegranate molasses.
4. In the meantime, do the following
   * Cut an onion
   * Cut the chicken in bite-sized pieces
   * In a separate pan, fry the onion until golden brown
   * Add the chicken and tumeric to the onion and fry for only a few minutes until the exterior is no longer raw
   * Turn off heat
5. Add the onion and chicken to the the other pan and let simmer for 30 min
6. In the meantime, cut the quince in bite sized pieces
7. After the chicken has simmered for 30 min, also add the quince. Now let it simmer for another hour.
8. If the stew is still very thin, you can take the lid off the pan while simmering to let it thicken.

Note: If you want a vegetarian version, you can fry oyster mushrooms with onion instead of chicken, but then you should add it at the same time as the quince.

Serve with (iranian/basmati) rice, salad and yoghurt.
